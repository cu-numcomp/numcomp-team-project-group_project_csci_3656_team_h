    "* Evan Ram - Evan wrote the testing code for allowing us to input matrices and see what their output was from Feng Wang. This was extremely important to being able to evaluate and compare.\n",
    "* Prateek Makhija - Prateek wrote the conclusion and did the analysis of why the python code is faster. Which have us the result that Feng Wang's code is not optimal. Also consulted with the group during the meetings to develop the strategy that broke the code. \n",
    "* James Douthit - James wrote the analysis of Feng Wang's SVD implementation and consulted with the group during meetings to develop our strategy for breaking the code.\n",
    "* Garrett Hempy - Built the timers and did the interpretation of the results of how it ran. Also consulted with the group during the meetings to develop the strategy that broke the code. "

    "## Introduction / methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we compare the SVD impementations of two matrix libraries, \"numpy\" and \"matrix.\" Numpy is a python library while matrix is in C++20. To begin, we looked at the matrix implementation of SVD, which is a 300-line function with purported scope of all 2d matrices. We wrote some matrices that we thought might break the library or create an unacceptable condition number, but the majority of our work is focused on comparing these libraries' performance across a series of benchmark SVD tests we created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a new library called Matrix written in C++20 (the C++20 language version should be finalized later this month). It is written by Feng Wang and can be found [here](https://github.com/fengwang/matrix). The library is distributed as a huge single header file (see `./fengwang-matrix/matrix.hpp`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also depend on `numpy` for matrix stuff in Python and `pillow` (Python image processing library) for loading in the C++ library's exported matrices (which can be serialized to bitmap image files)."

    "## Results and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "We observed that Feng Wang used the common method of SVD calculation by householder reduction. There are many algorithms for SVD, including the implemented Golub-Reinsch and methods utilizing properties of input matrix such as upper bidiagonal, which allow the algorithms to be much faster. In the implementation in the matrix.hpp header file, the creator of our package uses 4 for loops, the first of which puts the input matrix into bidiagonal form. The second and third loops he uses ensure that u and v are orthonormal while maintaining the solution's validity by premultiplying the singular values, which yields the left and right singular vectors. Finally, the matrix library rotates the solutions to be u_mxm and v_nxn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method by Feng Wang is inefficient compared to the numpy implementation because numpy is compiled optimally while the Feng Wang library hasn't been compiled as efficiently. As far as we could tell, there is no issue with Feng Wang's specific implementation and it returns residuals that are correct with most of the matrices we inputted. However, when we started to print our results, we noticed that the residuals were extremely high. We fixed this by switching the format of the file we exported our data to from a bmp to txt. The bmp conversion either has a bug, or was losing a lot of precision with our data because it caused our residuals to shoot up to the thousands. Both implementations of SVD are similar as the resulting data has very small differences. We also ran into the issue that numpy does not automatically convert sigma to a diagonal matrix, so we had to specifically set sigma to diagonal after we got the matrix from numpy.linalg.svd.\n",
    "\n",
    "After solving these issues, the underlying differences in speed did in fact seem attributable to data type differences and not the actual methods. As always, numpy is described as fast because it is mostly written in c, which is heralded as the fastest language due to its closeness to assembly allowing for more control over the machine code. Although Feng Wang's matrix library is also written in a low-level language, these compiler optimizations make a difference for the actual fine-grain speeds, enough to account for the more than 3x longer time Feng Wang's took.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final differences between our test reconstruction of A and numpy's was about 4 orders of magnitude larger than machine precision. This inaccuracy likely lies in Feng Wang's implementation, either from C++20's standard library inner product or from integer truncation from Feng's storage of the results in a custom type built on auto-typing. We suspect that if we included some tests of matrices that were extremely small, Feng's implementation would therefore totally fall apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions and open questions\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall, we got it to work. At the beginning we had issues with the residuals being high, but after figuring out how to fix it, we were able to get the results we were looking for. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Our initial prediction was that the numpy implementation of SVD will be more optimized than fengwang's implementation in C++, due to the fact that numpy is one of the main libraries used for matrix manipulations in Python. After running performance tests, the numpy SVD implementation performed much faster than the c++ implementation; by a factor of almost 4. When reconstructing A prime as well, we notice that numpy implementation is about 3 times faster than the c++ implementation. These reults match up with our intial prediction that the numpy implementation would out perform the c++ version.\n",
    "    After doing more research, we find out that actually c++ code is not neccessarly slower than the python code when the python code is made with a c foundation. So what Feng Wang most likely forgot to do is optimize the compilation with gcc in his C++ code. \n",

    "2. Why was the numpy implementation not convert sigma to a diagonal matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is it better to implement without any standard library functions for readability, or is total control a better goal when writing a library?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From our University of Texas paper, there are only 3 algorithms they identify to solve SVD that work on general mxn matrices: Jacobi, Householder, and Biorthogonalization. Is it worth it to put the matrix into upper bidiagonal form, or are the other algorithms requiring bidiagonal input matrices useful for some other application?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Since we found Feng Wang's implementation to be 3 times slower, is this possibly an algorithmic complexity difference? Because it was consistend across our tests, it seems that Feng Wang likely has simply 3 times as many calculations per loop with the same assymptotic complexity. How does numpy therefore have the same checks that Feng Wang's implementation employs as to not throw errors while still maintaining better speed?"
